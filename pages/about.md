I'm a science and technology of open platforms enthusiast native of Chile. Currently I reside in Paris, where I'm doing research contributing to the understanding of biological phenomena through a multidisciplinary approach mixing physics, applied mathematics and material science.

On the hacking front, I work passionately on [biotexturas][1]{: .pretty_border} and I aim to explore the interface of art, game and science by researching hardware/software (machines), wetware (life) and people --as wide open as it sounds.

The lovely photograph above was taken by my partner Javiera (云艺), who makes beautiful pictures with her film camera and share some of them on [her webpage](https://jpaz.me){: .pretty_border}.
