                &lt;p&gt;“… life may be compared to a piece of embroidery, of which, during the first half of his time, a man gets a sight of the right side, and during the second half, of the wrong. The wrong side is not so pretty as the right, but it is more instructive; it shows the way in which the threads have been worked together”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;– Arthur Schopenhauer&lt;/p&gt;
