post_title: Upgrading python version
---

This how I currently keep myself updated in the ever growing world of Python.

To manage multiple python versions I use pyenv:
```shell
pyenv install --list
pyenv install VERSION
```

(e.g. `pyenv install 3.9.0`)

Then, to change the global python version use:
```shell
pyenv global VERSION
```
 (e.g. `pyenv global 3.9.0`)


These are the libraries I normally use at the present time, and I use `pip` to manage them:

```shell
pip install numpy matplotlib pandas opencv-python jupyterlab scikit-learn seaborn
```

## Checking compatibility with Jupyter

Now, in order to use the latest version of python's kernel in jupyter, I have to modify `alfre/Library/Jupyter/kernels/python3/kernel.json`, specifying the version of python that I'm actually using.

To check which version of python jupyter is actually using, open a console inside jupyter's environment and type:

```python
import sys
print(sys.version)
```

## Uninstalling old versions
```shell
pyenv uninstall VERSION
```

(e.g. `pyenv uninstall 3.8.5`)
